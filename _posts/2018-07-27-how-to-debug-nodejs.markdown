Today, I am linking to a blog post I wrote for the IBM Digital DevOps blog called "Diagnosing poorly performing Node.js applications". This post takes you through an example of the process we follow for investigating and fixing performance issues.

[IBM Digital DevOps - Diagnosing poorly performing Node.js applications](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/digital-devops/diagnosing-poorly-performing-node-js-applications)

Enjoy!
