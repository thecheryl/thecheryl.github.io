Hello! My name is Cheryl Brown and I am currently a software engineer working on IBM.com. I enjoy learning and working on anything related to web development.

I will use this site to blog about technical topics and as a place to house my resume online.

And now, I will leave you with a little code snippet to get this thing started off!

{% highlight javascript %}
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// prints 'Hello, World!' to console
sayHello("World");
{% endhighlight %}

May your bugs be few, and your coding time uninterrupted!
